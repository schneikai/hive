Hive was installed successfully! Some last things you should know:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

      config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost:3000', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root 'home#index'

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     If you like, you can use a partial that comes with Hive:

       <%= render 'hive/shared/flash' %>

  4. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:
     TODO: This does not work yet.

       rails g hive:views
